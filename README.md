This is a simple Python console program that simulates a silent auction.
Each participant enters their name and bid amount, and once all bids are placed, the program determines the highest bidder.

- Validates input for continuing the auction (yes or no).
- Determines and displays the winner with the highest bid.
- Includes a logo banner imported from a separate logo.py file.

    main.py (this script)
    logo.py (containing auction_logo)
